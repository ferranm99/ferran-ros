Working with Eclipse Cyclone DDS [community-contributed]
=========================================================

Eclipse Cyclone DDS is a very performant and robust open-source DDS implementation.
Cyclone DDS is developed completely in the open as an Eclipse IoT project.

Install packages
----------------

The easiest way is to install from ROS 2 apt repository.
``${ROS_DISTRO}`` should be your ROS 2 version.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt install ros-${ROS_DISTRO}-rmw-cyclonedds-cpp

Build from source code
----------------------

Building from source code is also another way to install.

First, clone Cyclone DDS and rmw_cyclonedds in the ROS 2 workspace source directory.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ros2_ws/src
   git clone https://github.com/atolab/rmw_cyclonedds atolab/rmw_cyclonedds
   git clone https://github.com/eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds eclipse-cyclonedds/cyclonedds

Then, install Java and Maven to build the IDL preprocessor of Cyclone DDS.

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install maven default-jdk

Finally, run colcon build.

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ..
   colcon build --symlink-install

Switch to rmw_cyclonedds
------------------------

Switch from other rmw to rmw_cyclonedds by specifying the environment variable.

.. code-block:: bash

   export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp

Run the talker and listener
---------------------------

Now run ``talker`` and ``listener`` to test Cyclone DDS.

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker

.. code-block:: bash

   ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp listener
